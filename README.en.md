ChengJing is a Traditional-Chinese, local-first visual notes and AI research desktop application. Its central idea is a “Second Brain” that turns everyday fragments, meeting notes, and whiteboard plans into neurons, then helps reveal relationships between them.

> A local-first, frameless visual notebook and Second Brain. Supports OpenRouter, Gemma 4, custom AI providers, local MCP, and Traditional Chinese, Simplified Chinese, English, Japanese, and Korean interfaces.

## Use and licensing

ChengJing can be freely obtained, used, studied, copied, modified, forked, and shared for free. You may use it in personal projects, company workflows, or at large scale, and you may use your own tools or an AI agent to modify it.

The only substantive restriction is resale. You may not sell ChengJing itself, its source code, an installer, or a fork or modified version whose main functionality and value still come from ChengJing. Changing the name, appearance, or a small amount of code does not turn ChengJing into a product that may be sold as your own.

You may use ChengJing at work and integrate it into a larger product or service that adds substantial functionality of its own. The restriction is on selling ChengJing itself or a substantially equivalent modified version, not on ordinary business use.

This is source-available software rather than OSI-approved “Open Source” software, because the Open Source Definition does not allow a license to prohibit selling. It is nevertheless free to use, modify, fork, and share under the project’s [ChengJing Free Use and No Resale License 1.0](LICENSE.md). For a plain-language Traditional-Chinese explanation, see [LICENSE.zh-TW.md](LICENSE.zh-TW.md). Third-party packages and assets remain subject to their own licenses.

## Install

Cross-platform release: [0.10.0 for Android, Mac and Windows](https://github.com/Coyoter/chengjing-notes/releases/tag/v0.10.0). Install over the previous build without uninstalling. Google Play publication is handled separately; a GitHub release does not imply Play approval. Bidirectional Google sync requires compatible clients on every device; older desktop v0.9.5 supports snapshot backups only. See [Android details and known limitations](ANDROID.md).

Official installers are currently available for Apple Silicon Macs and Windows ARM64, Intel, and AMD x64 systems:

- [Download the latest release from GitHub Releases](https://github.com/Coyoter/chengjing-notes/releases/latest)
- [Windows ARM64: choose the ARM64 Installer in the latest release](https://github.com/Coyoter/chengjing-notes/releases/latest)
- [Windows Intel/AMD x64: choose the x64 Installer in the latest release](https://github.com/Coyoter/chengjing-notes/releases/latest)
- [Apple Silicon Mac: choose the ARM64 DMG in the latest release](https://github.com/Coyoter/chengjing-notes/releases/latest)

Use the ARM64 installer on a Windows ARM computer. Use the x64 installer on a regular Intel or AMD computer. The Windows installers are not currently signed with a commercial code-signing certificate, so SmartScreen may show “Unknown publisher,” and Smart App Control may block installation. Do not lower the security settings of your main computer just to install the app.

The macOS build is currently ad-hoc signed and is not notarized with an Apple Developer ID. If macOS blocks it, try opening it once, then use System Settings → Privacy & Security → Open Anyway.

## Main features

- Today workspace, quick snippets, and global command search
- Card library, block editor, tags, properties, backlinks, version history, archive, and trash
- Domain → topic → card knowledge hierarchy; moving or renaming a topic does not damage card content
- Global tags shared by cards, whiteboards, journals, and snippets
- Daily journals, cross-editor todos, a custom calendar, date timeline, due dates, source highlights, and restore
- Interactive whiteboard with cards and files placed directly on the canvas, zooming, dragging, connections, minimap, and auto-layout
- Project kanban boards with multiple boards and lists, drag-and-drop, dates, tags, checklists, attachments, search, filters, sorting, and favorites
- Tag database with table, kanban, stage, and custom-tag views
- Import for PDF, DOCX, Markdown, plain text, HTML, images, audio, and video
- Web article capture and YouTube source cards
- OpenRouter integration with local AES-256-GCM key storage, curated models, model synchronization, and custom model names
- Custom AI providers with multiple OpenAI-compatible gateways or local Ollama connections, per-profile Chat Completions or Responses API mode, model discovery, testing, and encrypted keys
- Gemma 4 E2B local WebGPU generation with on-demand download, progress display, and removal
- Global AI assistant, card actions, and a safe action plan for creating, editing, and deleting content
- Snippets that can be saved, pinned, edited, copied, converted into cards, or sent to a whiteboard, board, or Second Brain

## Selected recent releases

### v0.9.4: Second Brain model compatibility

- Fixes the case where Gemini 3.8 Flash worked in chat but its upstream provider rejected the Second Brain's full JSON Schema. ChengJing now selects a compatible structured-output mode automatically.
- Reasoning models such as DeepSeek reserve more of the output budget for the final JSON answer. A larger repair request is made only when the first response is incomplete.
- Accepts common model variations including `connections`, `links`, `relations`, `edges`, and field aliases, then validates neuron IDs, confidence, relation types, and evidence locally.
- Live OpenRouter checks confirmed that Gemini 3.8 Flash and DeepSeek V4 Flash 0731 each produced 12 valid links from the same synthetic 40-neuron dataset.
- Sidebar hover or keyboard focus now prepares the intended view before navigation. ChengJing keeps the current workspace visible until that code is ready instead of flashing a full-page loading skeleton, without eagerly loading every feature at startup.
- The Second Brain reuses expensive text segmenters and date formatters and counts keywords without a duplicate intermediate array, preserving the complete neuron and search scope.

### v0.9.3: integrity and performance health check

- Fixes transaction-aware undo, duplicate Markdown filenames, backup validation, attachment recovery, and atomic MCP updates while preserving formatting and task relationships.
- Search covers late matches, single characters, normalized text, and content beyond truncated indexes. Task counts now follow trash state.
- The Second Brain renders on demand when idle while retaining navigation, selection, and animations.
- Custom providers gain a Test a reply action and clearer configuration, authorization, quota, and server errors.
- [Full health-check report](HEALTH_CHECK.md).

### v0.9.2: Responses compatibility and a naturally sized Jump to bar

- The Jump to container now ends immediately after its final Support button instead of stretching into a large empty area. Narrow windows retain horizontal access to all eight destinations.
- When a Responses model explicitly rejects the optional `temperature` parameter, ChengJing automatically retries without it. Models that support temperature still honor the Creativity setting.
- ChengJing remembers that compatibility result for the same provider and model during the current app session, avoiding repeated failed requests.

### v0.9.1: Responses API and an organized Settings page

- Each custom provider can use Chat Completions or the Responses API independently. Existing profiles remain on their original mode.
- Responses mode uses `/responses`, `input`, `instructions`, and `max_output_tokens`. Remote gateways always receive `store: false`; Ollama uses its officially supported stateless flow.
- A compact Jump to bar links to Language, AI, Integrations, Updates, Quick capture, Appearance, Backup, and Support without wrapping or widening the page.
- AI settings now follow the selected engine: only its relevant key or local-model controls appear automatically. OpenRouter models and Custom provider details collapse when they are not active, but remain manually accessible.
- Creativity and local knowledge search now sit in a clearly labeled shared-AI group. No original control, value, or capability was removed.
- Gemini in the three featured OpenRouter models is now `google/gemini-3.8-flash`; the other two choices and their order are unchanged.
- The selected engine uses one coherent solid control surface; disabled MCP collapses to a summary, and its anchor expands it before scrolling.

### v0.9.0: local MCP and custom AI providers

- Codex, Claude Code, and other MCP-compatible tools can search and read ChengJing, then create or update content at the access level selected by the user.
- MCP is off by default and starts in read-only mode. Users can instead confirm every write in ChengJing or explicitly allow token-holding tools to write.
- The server binds only to `127.0.0.1`, validates Host and Origin, uses a separate encrypted token, limits request size, and is never exposed to the LAN or internet.
- Permanent deletion is not exposed. Existing items require their latest `updatedAt` value before an update, and each external write becomes one undoable ChengJing action.
- Advanced users can save and switch among OpenAI-compatible gateways and Ollama. Ollama defaults to `http://127.0.0.1:11434/v1`.
- Remote gateways require HTTPS; HTTP is limited to loopback. Provider keys are encrypted locally and excluded from backups.

### v0.8.2: compact Google button spacing

- Removes the unnecessary fixed minimum width from the Google connection button, eliminating the extra blank space after the label instead of redistributing it.
- The button now follows its localized content width while keeping 12px before the visible G, 10px between icon and label, and 12px after the label.
- Pixel-level QA verifies the insets, vertical alignment, structural spacing, and zero unused width across all five interface languages.

### v0.8.1: visible Google connection button

- Fixes the invisible Google connection button in 0.8.0, where a damaged embedded PNG left only a transparent click target.
- ChengJing now draws the neutral pill button itself and uses Google's official local SVG color G with visible localized text instead of a full-button PNG.
- Visual QA now verifies the rendered size, colors, text, actual SVG load, and a pre-connection screenshot. Google Brand Verification status does not control whether this button appears.

### v0.8.0: Google cloud and local backup

- A simpler settings surface with two independent methods: Google Cloud and Local
- A recommended 30-minute cloud interval that runs only while ChengJing is open and idle, and skips unchanged content
- A current cloud snapshot plus one previous-day rescue point; rescue data expires after 48 hours while the current snapshot remains
- Emergency previous-day restore is collapsed by default, clearly warned, confirmed again, and preceded by a local safety copy
- Cross-device conflict protection pauses uploads instead of silently overwriting a newer cloud snapshot
- Content-addressed attachments upload only once; local AI models, API keys, and OAuth tokens are excluded
- System-browser OAuth with PKCE, state validation, loopback callback, and only the non-sensitive `drive.appdata` scope
- Silent AES-256-GCM token storage on macOS without Keychain prompts, and silent DPAPI protection on Windows

### v0.7.5: native Windows ARM64 and x64 support

- Separate native ARM64 and Intel/AMD x64 installers
- Stable `ChengJing.exe` executable name while the desktop shortcut and interface remain “澄境”
- Native Windows title bar, Segoe UI, Ctrl/Alt shortcuts, and system-tray quick capture
- System-tray show/quit behavior, login background startup, and single-database-process protection
- Architecture-aware updates with file-size and SHA-256 verification before opening the installer

### v0.7.4: hierarchical todos

- Add subtasks from a todo’s context menu, with multiple levels, indentation, and completion progress
- Completing all subtasks completes the parent; reopening a subtask reopens its ancestors
- Completing a parent completes its subtree; adding a subtask to a completed parent reopens the parent
- Subtasks inherit the source card and initial due date

### v0.7.3: unscheduled next steps

- Convert snippets, card-library cards, and board cards into unscheduled todos without removing the original content
- Preserve the source link so users can return to the original context
- Prevent duplicate conversions from the same source while keeping different sources distinct

### v0.7.2: read the original PDF alongside extracted text

- Replace the unreliable white PDF embed with a recognizable source card and real first-page preview
- Open a full reader with page navigation, keyboard controls, zoom, fit-to-width, and saved copies
- Remove the original PDF while keeping extracted, searchable, editable text

### v0.7.1: visible editing entry points

- Put Edit first in context menus for cards, board cards, todos, snippets, highlights, and whiteboards
- Keep full card editing while using lightweight overlays for small items
- Do not treat an untouched, empty journal date as a real card or searchable content

### v0.7.0: long-term data and performance foundation

- Difference-based global undo/redo without copying the whole database for every action
- Viewport loading for the private Second Brain, with complete search across private data
- Indexed search and batched display for cards, databases, todos, snippets, and highlights
- File-system attachment storage with database paths, sizes, and SHA-256 metadata
- Incremental attachment backups and safer cleanup of unreferenced assets

## AI setup

### OpenRouter

1. Open Settings.
2. Choose OpenRouter.
3. Enter your own API key and select Save key.
4. Choose a curated model, synchronize the latest models, or enter `provider/model-name` manually.

The key is not stored in ordinary settings, the notes database, or backups. It is stored locally in the ChengJing data directory using AES-256-GCM encryption. This avoids storing the key in plain text, but it does not provide the same protection as a hardware-backed keychain if someone can fully read your macOS account files.

### Gemma 4 E2B

1. Open Settings.
2. Choose Gemma 4 E2B.
3. Select Download model.

The model is approximately 2.9–3.2 GB. After the first download, it can run offline. Generated text is not sent to OpenRouter or Google.

### Custom AI provider / Ollama

1. Open Settings and choose Custom AI provider.
2. Expand the advanced panel and choose either the broadly compatible Chat Completions mode or the newer Responses API mode. For Ollama, keep `http://127.0.0.1:11434/v1` and enter an installed model ID such as `qwen3:8b`.
3. For a custom gateway, choose OpenAI-compatible gateway and enter its HTTPS API URL, or an HTTP URL on localhost/private LAN IPs, plus the model ID and optional API key.
4. Save the connection, optionally fetch models or test it, then make it active.

ChengJing uses the OpenAI-compatible `/models` endpoint and calls either `/chat/completions` or `/responses` for generation. Remote Responses requests always use `store: false`; Ollama receives the necessary history without server-side conversation IDs. Remote services require HTTPS; HTTP accepts only localhost, loopback, RFC1918 private ranges (`10.0.0.0/8`, `172.16.0.0/12`, `192.168.0.0/16`), or IPv6 ULA. Keys stay encrypted on this computer and are excluded from backups.

### Codex / Claude Code MCP

1. Open Settings → External integrations and enable Local MCP.
2. Start with Ask every time; choose Read only if the tool should never change data.
3. After Copy Codex config, paste the whole block into `~/.codex/config.toml` (on Windows: `%USERPROFILE%\.codex\config.toml`). Paste the copied Claude Code command into a terminal and run it.
4. Keep ChengJing running. The tool can then search, read, create, and update notes, tasks, whiteboards, kanban boards, and neuron relationships.

The copied setup includes a private token that works only with the local ChengJing endpoint. Do not share it. If it is exposed, replace the token in Advanced connection settings; earlier configurations stop working immediately. MCP does not expose permanent deletion, and external writes are added to ChengJing's undo history.

### Google cloud backup

1. Open Settings → Backup and restore.
2. In Google Cloud, choose Sign in with Google.
3. Keep automatic backup enabled. The default interval is 30 minutes while ChengJing is open and idle.

ChengJing requests only `drive.appdata`, so it can manage only its own hidden backup space and cannot read any other Drive file. Cloud and local backup can run together. Emergency previous-day restore is only for an important deletion that has already synced; do not use it for everyday restore.

## Local data

Cards, whiteboards, journals, chats, and attachments are stored in IndexedDB inside Electron’s user-data directory. We recommend enabling both Google cloud and local backup; Complete JSON Backup can also be saved to an external drive.

## Development and verification

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
npm run typecheck
npm test
npm run qa
npm run qa:functional
npm run qa:second-brain
npm run qa:database-share
npm run qa:journal-polish
npm run qa:board-ime-security
npm run qa:frameless-themes
npm run qa:i18n

npm run qa:tags
npm run qa:auto-backup
npm run qa:live-google-backup
npm run qa:task-timeline
npm run smoke:electron-main
npm run smoke:electron
npm run dist:mac
```

The current validation suite covers TypeScript, frontend and Electron tests, persistence, version comparison, release parsing, DMG selection, dark/light/ink themes, responsive layouts, whiteboard interactions, Second Brain flows, database and tag operations, five-language UI, backups, update fallbacks, WebGPU, encrypted local storage, and packaged-app startup.

## Current boundaries

- This is a local-first single-user desktop app. Google accounts are used only for private backup; ChengJing does not provide its own account system, real-time multiplayer collaboration, or a mobile app.
- Daily reflection is a text aid for review, not medical or psychological diagnosis, and does not claim to read personality or the subconscious directly.
- Media cards can store media, subtitles, and notes; a separate built-in Whisper model is not included.
- URL import is currently used instead of a browser Web Clipper. A separate Chrome extension may be added later.
- Official Windows installers support ARM64 and Intel/AMD x64. Official macOS installers currently target Apple Silicon; Intel Mac and Linux installers are not published.
